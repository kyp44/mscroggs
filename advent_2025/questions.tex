  Some numbers contain a digit more than once (e.g. $313$, $111$, and $144$). Other numbers have digits that are all different (e.g. $123$, $307$, and $149$).

  How many three-digit numbers are there whose digits are all different?

  Eve writes down the numbers from $1$ to $10$ (inclusive).
  In total, she writes down $11$ digits.

  Noel writes down the number from $1$ to $100$ (inclusive).
  How many digits does he write down?

  Holly picks the number $513$, reverses it to get $315$, then adds the two together to make $828$.

  Ivy picks a three-digit number, reverses it, then adds the two together to make $968$.
  What is the smallest number that Ivy could have started with?

  Some numbers can be written as the sum of four consecutive numbers, for example: $142 = 34 + 35 + 36 + 37$.

  What is the mean of all the three-digit numbers that can be written as the sum of four consecutive numbers?

  The number $36$ is equal to two times the product of its digits.

  What is the only (strictly positive) number that is equal to four times the product of its digits?

  Put the digits $1$ to $9$ (using each digit exactly once) in the boxes so that the sums are correct.
  The sums should be read left to right and top to bottom ignoring the usual order of operations.
  For example, $4 + 3 \times 2$ is $14$, not $10$.
  Today's number is the product of the numbers in the red boxes.

  Carol organized a knockout competition in December 2024, which $6$ people entered.
  There were $2$ matches in the first round with the remaining two players given byes (so they went into the next round without playing a match).
  The second round was made up of two semi-finals, then one final match was played to decide the winner.
  In total $5$ matches were played.

  This year, Carol is organizing the competition again, but it has become a lot more popular: $355$ people have entered.
  While planning the tournament, she can decide which rounds to give people byes in.
  What is the smallest number of matches that could be included in the tournament?

  Angel wrote out a multiplication square for the numbers from $1$ to $3$ (the table has the numbers $1$ to $3$ in the top row and left column, then every other entry is equal to the number at the top of its column multiplied by the number at the left of its row):
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
      \hline
      1 & 2 & 3 \\
      \hline
      2 & 4 & 6 \\
      \hline
      3 & 6 & 9 \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

  The sum of the numbers in the bottom row is $18$. The sum of all the numbers in the table is $36$.

  Angel then wrote out another multiplication square with the numbers from $1$ to $n$.
  The sum of all the numbers in the new table is $2025$.
  What is the sum of the numbers in the bottom row of the new table?
