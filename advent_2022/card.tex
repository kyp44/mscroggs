\cproblem{1}{5}{\card@xxii@i}{
  Just working through the primes starting at $1$, the answer is clearly $5$, which is two more than $3$ and two less than $7$, both of which are also prime.

\cproblem{2}{49}{\card@xxii@ii}{
  While this would be really simple to just manually calculate, it is more fun (though perhaps more work) to derive an easier formula.
  Clearly the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers is going to be
  \gath{
    \sumo{n} = \sum_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) = 2 \sum_{k=1}^n k - \sum_{k=1}^n 1 = \frac{2n(n+1)}{2} - n = n^2 \,.
  }
  Thus our answer is $\sumo{7} = 7^2 = 49$.
}

\cproblem{3}{33}{\card@xxii@iii}{
  From the equation derived in the previous problem, clearly the answer is $\sqrt{1089} = 33$.
}

\cproblem{4}{1}{\card@xxii@iv}{
  Since $7$ is prime, the quotient group $\ints/7\ints$ is cyclic, and indeed $4$ is a generator for it.
  From this it follows that \emph{any} integer can be obtained by adding only integer multiples of $4$ and $7$.
  As an example, clearly $2 \cdot 4 - 1 \cdot 7 = 1$, which is of course the smallest positive integer period.
}

\cproblem{5}{80}{\card@xxii@v}{
  This is similar to the previous problem, but not so straightforward because our two integers are not coprime.
  In particular, $\gcd(240, 400) = 80$ so that only integer multiples of $80$ are obtainable by adding integer multiples of $240$ and $400$.
  Hence, our answer is of course $80$, noting that $2 \cdot 240 - 1 \cdot 400 = 80$ as an example of how to attain this.
