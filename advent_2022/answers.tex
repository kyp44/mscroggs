\aproblem{1}{162}{\advent@xxii@i}{
  Since $p_1 = (9,0)$ is a vertex and the $y$-axis is a line of symmetry, it must be that a second vertex is $p_2 = (-9, 0)$.
  Since there must be four vertices, and both $p_1$ and $p_2$ are on the $x$-axis, it must be that the other two vertices are on the $y$-axis.
  This is because any vertex not on either axis would result in four vertices not on either axis due to the axes being lines of symmetry, and a rectangle cannot have six vertices!
  It then must be that the two $y$-axis vertices are at $p_3 = (0, 9)$ and $p_4 = (0, -9)$, since any other points that possess the required symmetry would result in a parallelogram without right angles.

  Therefore, our rectangle is also square that clearly has sides of $s = \sqrt{9^2 + 9^2} = 9\sqrt{2}$.
  The area is then of course $A = s^2 = 81 \cdot 2 = 162$.
