\cproblem{1}{1936}{\card@xxiv@i}{
  Clearly larger factors will produce a larger product.
  It is also obvious that the largest two-digit number that can be produced using the digits $1$ to $4$ is $44$.
  Hence, the largest product is $44 \cdot 44 = 44^2 = 1936$.
}

\cproblem{2}{9899999901}{\card@xxiv@ii}{
  Similar to problem~1 above, the largest product will obviously be
  \gath{
    99 \cdot 99999999 = 9899999901.
  }
}

\cproblem{3}{1225}{\card@xxiv@iii}{
  Drawing from the 2019, Dec 7 problem, the sum of the coefficients of $(ax + b)^n$ is
  \gath{
    S(a, b, n) = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k.
  }
  So, for the example, we have
  \gath{
    S(2, 3, 2) = \sum_{k=0}^2 \binom{2}{k} 2^{2 - k} 3^k =  2^2 \cdot 3^0 + 2 \cdot 2^1 \cdot 3^1 + 2^0 \cdot 3^2 = 4 + 12 + 9 = 25
  }
  as expected.
  For the main problem we have our answer:
  \gath{
    S(30, 5, 2) = \sum_{k=0}^2 \binom{2}{k} 30^{2 - k} 5^k =  30^2 \cdot 5^0 + 2 \cdot 30^1 \cdot 5^1 + 30^0 \cdot 5^2 = 900 + 300 + 25 = 1225.
  }
}

\cproblem{4}{177147}{\card@xxiv@iv}{
  From the previous problem, we have our answer as
  \gath{
    S(2, 1, 11) = \sum_{k=0}^{11} \binom{11}{k} 2^{11 - k} 1^k = \sum_{k=0}^{11} \binom{11}{k} 2^{11 - k} = \sum_{k=0}^{11} \binom{11}{k} 2^k = 177147,
  }
  which was calculated using Python.
}

\cproblem{5}{6427}{\card@xxiv@v}{
  It turns out that $41306329 = 6427^2$ and $6427$ is prime.
  Therefore, the only factors of $41306329$ are $1$, $6427$, and $41306329$ itself.
  The geometric mean of these factors is then our answer:
  \gath{
    \sqrt[3]{1 \cdot 6427 \cdot 41306329} = \sqrt[3]{6427 \cdot 6427^2} = \sqrt[3]{6427^3} = 6427
  }
}

\cproblem{6}{8464}{\card@xxiv@vi}{
  We know from the 2021, Dec~1 problem that \emph{only} such number is $92^2 = 8464$.
  This was verified using a brute force Python program.
}

\cproblem{7}{2801}{\card@xxiv@vii}{
  Since $n = 7^4 = 2401$ is a prime factorization, we know that there are $4 + 1 = 5$ factors (including $1$ and itself).
  These factors are exactly the $5$ numbers $f_i = 7^i$ where $0 \leq i \leq 4$.
  Thus, their sum is
  \gath{
    \sum_{i=0}^4 f_i = \sum_{i=0}^4 7^i = \frac{7^5 - 1}{7 - 1} = \frac{16806}{6} = 2801.
  }
  This was verified using Python.
}

\cproblem{8}{170260}{\card@xxiv@viii}{
  From the 2019, Dec~3 problem, we know that this is equivalent to the easier problem of how many square numbers there are between $1$ and $m = 28988500000$.
  Now, the square root of $m$ is a little over $170260$ so that $170260^2$ is less than $m$ but $170261^2$ is over it.
  Therefore, our answer is that there are $170260$ square numbers between $1$ and $m$, namely the numbers $i^2$ where $1 \leq i \leq 170260$.
