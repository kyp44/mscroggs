\newcommand\factorial@minus[2]{
  We can utilize the results of the Dec 2023, Dec 4 problem.
  In this, it was proven that the largest possible $n$ for which $(n!-a)/(n-a)$ is an integer is $n = 2a$.
  So, in our case we have $a = #1$ so that our answer is $n = 2 \cdot #1 = #2$.

\cproblem{3}{64}{\card@xxiii@iii}{
  We can utilize the results of the Dec 2023, Dec 2 problem.
  It was derived there that the sum of the first $n$ even numbers plus half of the next even number is
  \gath{
    s_n = (n+1)^2
  }
  so that our answer is $s_7 = (7+1)^2 = 8^2 = 64$.

\cproblem{4}{94}{\card@xxiii@iv}{
  We can utilize the results of the Dec 2023, Dec 2 problem.
  It was derived there that, if the sum of the first $n$ even numbers plus half of the next even number is $s_n$, then
  \gath{
    n = \sqrt{s_n} - 1.
  }
  Thus, our answer is $n = \sqrt{9025}-1 = 95-1 = 94$.
