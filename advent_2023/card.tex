\newcommand\factorial@minus[2]{
  We can utilize the results of the \xref@advent{2023}{4}.
  In this, it was proven that the largest possible $n$ for which $(n!-a)/(n-a)$ is an integer is $n = 2a$.
  So, in our case we have $a = #1$ so that our answer is $n = 2 \cdot #1 = #2$.

\cproblem{3}{64}{\card@xxiii@iii}{
  We can utilize the results of the \xref@advent{2023}{2}.
  It was derived there that the sum of the first $n$ even numbers plus half of the next even number is
  \gath{
    s_n = (n+1)^2
  }
  so that our answer is $s_7 = (7+1)^2 = 8^2 = 64$.

\cproblem{4}{94}{\card@xxiii@iv}{
  We can utilize the results of the \xref@advent{2023}{2}.
  It was derived there that, if the sum of the first $n$ even numbers plus half of the next even number is $s_n$, then
  \gath{
    n = \sqrt{s_n} - 1.
  }
  Thus, our answer is $n = \sqrt{9025}-1 = 95-1 = 94$.
}

\cproblem{5}{40}{\card@xxiii@v}{
  We can utilize the results of the \xref@card{2019}{5}.
  There it was derived that the largest quadrilateral is a square with area
  \gath{
    A = 2r^2,
  }
  where $r$ is the radius of the circle.
  In our case the circle has an area of $A_c = \pi r^2 = 20 \pi$ so that clearly $r^2 = 20$.
  Thus, the area of our square is $A = 2r^2 = 2 \cdot 20 = 40$.
}

\cproblem{6}{60}{\card@xxiii@vi}{
  We can utilize the results of the \xref@advent{2018}{2}.
  There it was derived that the largest dodecagon is that with a circumradius $r$ the same as the circle with area
  \gath{
    A_d = 3r^2,
  }
  Our circle has an area of $A_c = \pi r^2 = 20\pi$ so that clearly $r^2 = 20$.
  Hence, the area of the largest dodecagon is $A_d = 3r^2 = 3 \cdot 20 = 60$.
}

\cproblem{7}{12}{\card@xxiii@vii}{
  Let $N_d(n)$ denote the number of $n$-digit numbers such that all the digits are from $1$ to $d$, and one of those valid digits $1 \leq k \leq d$ (which may as well be $k=1$ as in our case) appears exactly $n-1$ times.
  For a single digit number, it must be that $N_d(1) = d-1$ since $k$ must appear zero times so that there are $d-1$ valid digits left.

  Now, for an $n$-digit number where $n > 1$, if the first digit is not $k$, then there are $d-1$ choices, i.e. all the valid digits except $k$.
  In this case there are $n-1$ digits remaining but $n-1$ of them must be $k$, and hence the rest must \emph{all} be $k$.
  On the other hand, if the first digit is $k$, then there are $n-1$ digits remaining and $n-2$ must be $k$ since we have already used one $k$.
  Of course there are $N_d(n-1)$ such possible values for the remaining digits.
  This leads to the following recursive formula:
  \gath{
    N_d(1) = d - 1 \label{eqn:07:base} \\
    N_d(n) = (d-1) + N_d(n-1).
  }

  We claim that this results in the closed formula
  \gath{
    N_d(n) = n(d-1), \label{eqn:07:closed}
  }
  which we show by induction on $n$.
  First, for $n = 1$, we clearly have $N_d(1) = 1 \cdot(d-1) = d-1$ as in \eqref{eqn:07:base}.
  Next, assume that \eqref{eqn:07:closed} is true for $n$.
  Then we have that
  \gath{
    N_d(n+1) = (d-1) + N_d(n) = (d-1) + n(d-1) = (n+1)(d-1),
  }
  which shows that \eqref{eqn:07:closed} holds for $n+1$, completing the proof.

  Thus, our answer is $N_5(3) = 3 (5 - 1) = 3 \cdot 4 = 12$.
}

\cproblem{8}{75}{\card@xxiii@viii}{
  We can use the results of the previous problem.
  There, it was derived that in which it was derived that the number of $n$-digit numbers with this property is
  \gath{
    N_5(n) = 4n.
  }
  Eve has worked out that $N_5(n) = 300 = 4n$ so that, of course, $n = 300/4 = 75$.
