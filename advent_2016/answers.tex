\aproblem{1}{563}{\advent@xvi@i}{
  Suppose that today's number has the three digits $d_2 d_1 d_0$.
  If $d_2$ or $d_1$ were removed then the last digit of the sum would be $d_0 + d_0 = 2d_0$ and so would be even.
  As $9$ is odd, it means that $d_0$ must be the digit that was removed so that the two digit number therefore has digits $d_2 d_1$.
  Thus we have
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c@{\,}c@{\,}c@{\,}c}
      & $d_2$ & $d_1$ & $d_0$ \\
      $+$ &   & $d_2$ & $d_1$ \\
      \hline
      & 6 & 1 & 9
    \end{tabular} \,.
  \end{center}
  Moreover, no digits can add to $19$ (since the biggest digit $9 + 9 = 18 < 19$) so that
  \gath{
    d_0 + d_1 = 9 \label{eqn:01:d0d1}
  }
  with no carry to the next digit.
  Since the middle digit of the sum is $1$, either $d_1 + d_2 = 1$ or $d_1 + d_2 = 11$.
  In the former case it has to be that $d_1 = 0$ and $d_2 = 1$ since otherwise the two digit number would actually only be a one digit number.
  However, in this case, it cannot possibly be that the first digit of the sum is $6$.
  So it must be that in fact
  \gath{
    d_1 + d_2 = 11 \label{eqn:01:d1d2}
  }
  so that $d_2 + 1 = 6$ because of the carry, and thus $d_2 = 6 - 1 = 5$.
  Hence $d_1 = 11 - d_2 = 11 - 5 = 6$ by \eqref{eqn:01:d1d2}, from which it follows from \eqref{eqn:01:d0d1} that $d_0 = 9 - d_1 = 9 - 6 = 3$.
  Therefore today's number is $d_2 d_1 d_0 = 563$.

\aproblem{2}{435}{\advent@xvi@ii}{
  If they are placed in an optimal way, each time a plane is added, it can intersect every already-placed plane.
  So clearly a single plane has $0$ intersections, adding a second plane adds $1$ intersection, adding a third plane adds $2$ more intersections, etc.
  Thus for $n$ planes the maximum number of intersecting lines is a triangular number:
  \gath{
    f(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i = \frac{(n-1)(n-1 + 1)}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \,.
  }
  Hence our answer is $f(30) = 435$.

\aproblem{3}{798}{\advent@xvi@iii}{
  Clearly the smallest such cube is such that the base of the pyramid is square and coincides with one side of the cube.
  The height of the pyramid then is also the same as the sides of the square base.
  If the sides of the enclosing cube have length $s$, then the base length, base width, and height of the pyramid are all $l = w = h = s$.
  The volume of the pyramid is then
  \gath{
    V_p = \frac{lwh}{3} = \frac{s^3}{3} \,.
  }
  The volume of the cube is of course simply
  \gath{
    V_c = s^3
  }
  so that $V_c = 3 V_p = 3 \cdot 266 = 798$, which is our answer.

\aproblem{6}{819}{\advent@xvi@vi}{
  Let $S(k)$ denote the digital sum of a non-negative integer $k$.
  We will prove the following set identity:
  \gath{
    \braces{S(k) \mid 0 \leq k \leq 10^n} = \braces{0, 1, \ldots, 9n}\,, \label{eqn:06:hyp}
  }
  TODO need to modify and complete below proof.
  We show both of these by induction on $n$.
  First, for $n = 1$, clearly for any $0 \leq k \leq 10^n = 10$, the digital sum $S(k)$ is either just zero through nine in the case of a single-digit number, or $S(k) = 1$ for $10$ so that $0 \leq S(k) \leq 9 = 9n$ (showing 1 above) and that all of these are covered (showing 2 above).
  Now suppose that 1 and 2 above are true for $n$.
  Let $0 \leq k \leq 10^{n+1}$.
  In the case where $0 \leq k < 10^{n+1}$, then $k$ has $n$ digits, where we can consider $k < 10^n$ as an $n$-digit number whose first digit is zero.
  So let $d$ be the first digit of $k$ so that $0 \leq d \leq 9$, and let $m$ be the integer formed from the remaining digits so that of course $m$ has $n-1$ digits and hence $0 \leq m < 10^n$ so that $0 \leq S(m) \leq 9n$ by 1 above (the induction hypothesis).
  Then we have
  \gath{
    0 + 0 \leq d + S(m) \leq 9 + 9n \non
    0 \leq S(k) \leq 9(n+1) \,,
  }
  which shows 1 above.
  These show the desired result by induction.
